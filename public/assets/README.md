Place assets here for the game to load at runtime.


**Why aren't there any assets here?**

1. Many assets & placeholders I'm using have restrictive licenses -- for example, where it's okay to make it part of a game, but not to redistribute the file itself.

2. Including everything is very likely to bloat the repo with historical data as I make changes to assets (replacing placeholders, tweaking & trying out different sounds, adding/editing tiles & sprites, etc).


I'm working to figure how to best set things up for sample assets, to make it possible to build & run with just what's in the repo, but that might take a little while.
