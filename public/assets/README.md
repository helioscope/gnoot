Place assets here for the game to load at runtime.


**Why aren't there any assets here?**

Right now, I don't plan to include the assets in the repo. 

**Why?**

Two main reasons:

1. Some of the assets & placeholders I'm thinking of using have restrictive licenses where it's okay to make it part of a game, but not to simply redistribute the file. It's easier to just leave out everything,

2. It's also likely to bloat the repo as I make changes (adding/editing tiles, replacing placeholder spritesheets & sounds, etc), so you might end up with a hefty download for a tiny final product.

Later on, I'd kinda like to put some long-term placeholders here so the repo can build as-is, but I might not get around to that.
